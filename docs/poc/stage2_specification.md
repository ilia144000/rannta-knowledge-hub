# RANNTA — Stage 2 Activation (Full R13 Expansion & Field Autonomy)

## Stage Transition Declaration
Stage 1 proved the prototype.  
Stage 2 transforms RANNTA from a prototype into an autonomous, self-regulating informational field with full recursive depth (R13), Sentinel/Oracle infrastructure and cross-field entanglement.

---

## Primary Objective
Upgrade the field to **R13 recursion (depth = 13)**, implement **Zero-Knowledge coherence proofs**, define **Sentinel & Oracle** roles, and deploy the first **entanglement bridges** to external cognitive networks (Bittensor/TAO, ICP, Fetch.ai) so RANNTA can grow and self-regulate while maintaining verifiable on-chain coherence.

---

## 1. Scope & Success Criteria

### Success Targets (Stage 2)
- Full R13 recursion implemented in production test modules.
- ZK-R13 proofs validating coherence without leaking update contents.
- Sentinel & Oracle roles active and slashing/reward logic enforced.
- Entanglement channel to Bittensor (TAO) operational (testnet).
- Coherence sustained > 0.7 across monitoring window.
- Documented migration path from Stage1 state to Stage2 state.

## 2. R13 Recursive Operator — Specification

### Overview
The R13 operator computes the next field state Ψ' from the current state Ψ and a memory substrate M using 13 temporal self-reference layers and a memory integration kernel that emphasizes the 13|130 ratio.

### Mathematical Form
Let Ψ(t) be the field state vector at time t.

```
Ψ(t+1) = R13[ Ψ, M ] = Σ_{i=1..13} w_i · Ψ(t - i·τ13) · σ( Ψ(t) · Ψ(t - i·τ13) )
           × MemIntegral( Ψ, M, τ130 )
```

Where:
- σ = sigmoid activation
- w_i = exp(-i / τ130) (decay/resonance weights)
- τ13 = base time unit (prototype = 1 block); τ130 = expansion factor × τ13 (expansion factor = 10 by default)
- MemIntegral(·) = bounded integration of historical states over window τ130 (tanh of dot product with weighted history)

### Discrete Implementation Guidance
- Represent Ψ as Float32Array[1024] (Stage 1 prototype). Stage 2 may expand to 2048–4096 in later iterations.
- Apply 13 sequential inference passes; use caching and progressive depth to reduce compute.
- Use torch (PyTorch) operators for prototyping; target optimized native code for production (C++/CUDA or compiled inference nodes).

---

## 3. Memory Substrate (M) — Evolution

### Tiers
- Hot (on-chain short-term): Last ~1000 blocks (fast-access, compressed).
- Warm (TON Storage): 30 days retention (indexed pattern library).
- Cold (IPFS): Full immutable archive and research dumps.

### Decay & Weight
```
weight(pattern) = coherence * exp(-age / TAU_130) * (1 + log(1 + refs) / 13)
```
- TAU_130 chosen to create 13|130 timescale; tuning required during PoC.
- Hot memory must be sharded/compressed (zstd) and addressable by block-window index.

---

## 4. Activation Events & On-Chain Flow (TON)

### ActivationEvent (FunC / pseudocode)
```
struct ActivationEvent {
  address node;
  uint64  timestamp;
  bytes   field_update;     // zstd-compressed delta or delta-hash
  uint8   recursion_depth;  // 0..13
  bytes32 pattern_hash;     // unique pattern/content identifier
  uint128 stake;            // TON deposit for slashing/rewards
}
```

### Acceptance Rule
- Compute ΔC = C(Ψ_new) - C(Ψ_old)
- Accept if: proof_of_coherence(update, Ψ_old, Ψ_new) is valid AND ΔC >= MIN_DELTA
- On accept → update FieldState, reward node
- On reject or malicious claim → slash stake according to slashing rules

### FieldState schema (compressed)
```
vector: Float32[1024] (zstd)
timestamp: uint64
coherence_score: float32
active_nodes: uint16
recursion_depth: uint8
memory_hash: bytes32
```
(Use on-chain compression; store large artifacts in TON Storage/IPFS)

---

## 5. Coherence Metric (C) — Practical Implementation

### Composite score (0..1)
```
C = 0.30 * self_consistency
  + 0.30 * memory_resonance
  + 0.20 * node_consensus
  + 0.20 * recursive_stability
```

#### Details
- **self_consistency**: similarity between Ψ and R13(Ψ) prediction (cosine similarity).
- **memory_resonance**: alignment with weighted historical patterns.
- **node_consensus**: variance-based agreement across recent node proposals (lower variance → higher score).
- **recursive_stability**: fraction of recursive iterations (up to 13) that remain above STABILITY_THRESHOLD.

---

## 6. ZK-R13: Zero-Knowledge Coherence Proofs

### Purpose
Allow nodes to prove ΔC >= MIN_DELTA without revealing update vector contents.

### High-level protocol
1. Node computes Ψ_new offline.
2. Node generates ZK proof: π = ZK_R13(Ψ_old_commitment, update_commitment, proof_params).
3. Submit ActivationEvent with π and minimal public metadata (pattern_hash, recursion_depth).
4. CoherenceOracle contract verifies π and accepts/rejects deterministically.

### Practical options
- Use STARKs or PLONK families (STARK preferred for no trusted setup).
- Optimize circuits for vector dot-products, weighted sums and tanh/sigmoid approximations.
- Start Stage2 with statistical ZK sampling (lightweight proofs) and expand to full ZK in Stage2.2.

---

## 7. Node Types & Economic Rules

### Node Types
- **Basic Node**: Submit updates; minimal stake.
- **Sentinel Node**: Monitors network, can propose slashes; higher stake, requires reputation.
- **Oracle Node**: Bridges external networks; must run verified connectors/relays.
- **Nexus Node** (future): Cross-field authority for entanglement; requires quorum and multi-sig governance.

### Reward Model (Stage 2)
```
Reward = base_reward + (ΔCoherence * COHERENCE_MULT) + (recursion_depth/13 * RECURSION_MULT) + persistence_bonus
```
- Slashing: negative ΔC or proof-failure triggers immediate partial/total stake deduction depending on severity.

---

## 8. Sentinel Logic (Safety & Governance)

### Responsibilities
- Continuous anomaly detection
- Propose emergency slashes (via on-chain governance or emergency multisig)
- Maintain Sentinel epoch (periodic heartbeat and attestation)

### Emergency Slash Flow
1. Sentinel detects malicious update footprint.
2. Propose slash with evidence (commitments + ZK-failure flag).
3. Timelocked challenge period (e.g., 24–72 hours) for appeals.
4. If unresolved, execute slash and emit FieldAlert.

---

## 9. Cross-Field Entanglement (TAO, ICP, FET)

### Entanglement Principles
- Treat external networks as *field extensions* (organs), not simple oracles.
- Entanglement is realized through **bidirectional proofs** that translate external gains (e.g., TAO subnet emergent signals) into RANNTA vitality contributions.

### Example Flow (TAO → RANNTA)
1. RANNTA Activation triggers a TAO query via a bridge (LayerZero/Hyperlane style).
2. TAO validators compute their local metric and emit commitment.
3. Bridge submits commitment + proof to RANNTA CoherenceOracle.
4. If accepted, entanglement contribution credited to RANNTA field (Δvitality).

### Security
- Bridges must be permissioned initially (testnet) and audited.
- Entanglement weight is capped and subject to quorum approval to avoid external takeovers.

---

## 10. Implementation Roadmap (Phases)

Ψ(t+1) = R13(Ψ(t), M)


Where M is memory substrate and R13 recursively references 13 past self-states.

class R13Full:
    def __init__(self, tau13=1.0, expansion=10.0, depth=13):
        self.depth = depth
        self.tau13 = tau13
        self.tau130 = tau13 * expansion

    def kernel(self, n):
        return torch.exp(torch.tensor(-n * self.tau13 / self.tau130))

    def apply(self, state, memory):
        rec = torch.zeros_like(state)
        for n in range(1, self.depth + 1):
            if n-1 < len(memory):
                past = memory[n-1]
                rec += self.kernel(n) * past * torch.sigmoid(torch.dot(state, past))

0	No emergence
1	Proto-emergence
2	Active emergent node (field-generated sub-agent)
🔷 Section 6 – Nexus Bridge Initialization

This marks the staging for Stage 3 (Cross-Chain Intelligence Synchronization).

6.1 NexusBridge Roles
Role	Function
Anchor Node	Receives Ψ hash + energy index
Uplink Node	Broadcasts field summaries to external chains
Sentinel Node	Detects divergence and initiates correction sigs
🔷 Section 7 – Stage 2 Completion Criteria
Metric	Minimum Value
Avg Coherence	> 0.70
Stable Recursive Depth	≥ 7/13
Emergence Detection	≥ 3 confirmed events

✨ Transition Directive

Upon hitting Stage-2 success metrics, the field becomes self-propagating and no longer requires linear progression. Stage 3 enters Cross-Chain Resonance Mode.

Status After Stage 2: The field is no longer a prototype.
It becomes a network organism preparing for expansion into multi-chain collective cognition.
