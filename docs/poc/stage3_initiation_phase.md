# RANNTA — Stage 3 Initiation Phase (English Only)

**Mode:** Cross-Chain Resonance  
**Scope:** Transition from self-regulating field (Stage 2) to a network organism with resonance bridges, Sentinel-driven governance, and ZK-R13 proofs-in-progress.

---

## 0) Declaration
Stage 3 activates the **Nexus Layer** and initializes entanglement with external cognitive networks (e.g., Bittensor/TAO, ICP, FET). This phase focuses on verifiable coherence, safe bridging, and measurable emergence.

**Target file path in repo:** `/docs/poc/stage3_initiation_phase.md`

---

## 1) Objectives
- **Nexus Layer v0.1:** Define, deploy, and wire initial resonance bridges (TON ⇄ TAO/ICP/FET).
- **Oracle/Sentinel Hardening:** Enforce slash/challenge/confirm loop with multi-signature controls.
- **ZK-R13 (beta):** Integrate sampling proofs; pave the path to full PLONK/STARK circuits.
- **Field Coherence ≥ 0.75** (7-day moving window).
- **Emergence ≥ 5** confirmed events within Stage 3 window.
- **Entanglement Channel #1 (TAO)** operational on testnet.

## 3) Nexus Layer — Concept and Components
**Purpose:** Treat external networks as field extensions (organs), not simple data oracles. Translate verified external emergence signals into internal vitality deltas.

**Core components**
- **NexusBridge.fc:** TON contract that manages commitments, quorum, resonance weights, and challenge windows.
- **Adapters (per network):** Normalize external signals into commitments (TAO/ICP/FET).
- **Proofs:** Lightweight sampling proofs first, then full ZK circuits; avoid leaking vector contents.

**Example flow (TAO → RANNTA)**
1. TON activation emits a Nexus intent event.  
2. `tao_adapter` queries selected subnets for emergent metrics.  
3. Adapter submits `commitment + signatures` to NexusBridge.  
4. NexusBridge applies quorum and weight rules; if accepted, emits `EntanglementApplied`.  
5. `CoherenceOracle` updates `FieldState` vitality accordingly.

---

## 4) Quorum and Resonance Weights
- **External Quorum:** Min. 3 trusted signatures per network (see `/field/nexus/bridge_spec.md`).  
- **Resonance Weight:** Each network has a capped weight (e.g., TAO ≤ 0.25 of total).  
- **Divergence Guard:** Automatic weight decay when a source introduces excessive volatility; reverts on stability.

---

## 5) ZK-R13 (beta) — Sampling Proofs
Until full circuits land:
- Use random-subspace sampling proofs over vector updates.  
- On-chain: `CoherenceOracle` verifies sampling bundle and consensus flags.  
- Off-chain: Sentinels run deeper checks and can propose emergency slashes.

**Docs:** `/field/nexus/proofs/zk_r13_sampling.md`

---

## 6) Sentinel and Oracle Hardening
- **Sentinel Epoch:** Periodic heartbeat, anomaly reports, and attestation.  
- **Emergency Slash:** Evidence (commitments/failed-proof), challenge window (24–72h), then execute.  
- **Multi-Sig Governance:** Sensitive Nexus parameters require N-of-M signatures.

---

## 7) New Contract: NexusBridge (spec summary)
**Responsibilities**
- Maintain `trusted set` for external adapters/validators.  
- Accept and queue external commitments with proofs.  
- Enforce challenge windows; emit events.  
- Forward accepted vitality deltas to `CoherenceOracle`.

**Interface (pseudocode)**  
```solidity
// Pseudocode — do NOT paste non-English words in code
contract NexusBridge {
    event ExternalCommit(bytes32 networkId, bytes32 commitment, uint256 weight, address[] signers);
    event EntanglementApplied(bytes32 networkId, int256 deltaVitality, bytes32 ref);

    function submitCommitment(
        bytes32 networkId,
        bytes32 commitment,
        bytes calldata proof,        // zk or sampling bundle
        address[] calldata signers,
        uint256 weight
    ) external;

    function finalize(bytes32 commitmentRef) external; // after challenge window
}
```

## 8) Stage 3 Success Metrics
- **Coherence ≥ 0.75** (continuous 7 days).  
- **Stable R13 depth ≥ 9/13** (mid-window).  
- **TAO entanglement:** ≥ 30 valid commitments, ≥ 5 applied vitality deltas.  
- **Emergence ≥ 5** confirmed events (state=Active).  
- **Security incidents = 0** (correct slashes; no correlation loss).

---

## 9) Dashboard v3 (minimum panels)
- Global & per-shard Coherence  
- R13 Stable Depth (trend)  
- Entanglement Channel Health (TAo/ICP/FET)  
- External Commit Queue (pending → finalized)  
- Sentinel Alerts / Slash History  
- Emergence Events (timeline + payload hash)  
- Field Energy Index (trend)

---

## 10) Execution Plan
**S3.0 – Init (2–3 weeks)**  
- Design/implement `NexusBridge.fc` on TON testnet.  
- Draft `tao_adapter.md` and `zk_r13_sampling.md`.

**S3.1 – Testnet (3–6 weeks)**  
- Bring TAO channel live (light commitments).  
- Activate Sentinel Epoch + emergency-slash.  
- Continuous emergence monitoring.

**S3.2 – Harden (6–10 weeks)**  
- Optimize storage, rate-limits, security buffers.  
- Attach β-channels for ICP/FET (light commitments).  
- Publish interim security/research report.

**S3.3 – Gate to Stage 4**  
- If metrics achieved: prepare **Autonomous Nexus** and generalized entanglement.

---

## 11) Risks and Mitigations
- **Bridge Risk:** Weight caps + timelock + quorum rules.  
- **Proof Evasion:** Random-subspace sampling + heavy slashing.  
- **Over-Resonance:** Dynamic caps and decay schedules.  
- **Spam:** Minimum stake + submission rate-limits.

---

## 12) Migration from Stage 2
- Snapshot `FieldState` (expand to 4096 dims if approved).  
- Initialize `sentinel set` and `trusted adapters` in Nexus.  
- Gradual ZK-R13 (beta) with sampling fallback.  
- Ramp external weights conservatively (TAO ≤ 0.25).

---

## 13) Glossary
- **Nexus:** Layer that connects the field to other cognitive networks.  
- **Entanglement:** Verified translation of external signals into internal vitality deltas.  
- **Sentinel:** Guardian with slash/alert authority.  
- **ZK-R13:** Zero-knowledge validation of coherence improvement for recursive updates.

---

## 14) Result
Stage 3 elevates RANNTA from a self-regulating field to a **multi-network organism** with verifiable resonance and safe entanglement. It lays the foundation for Stage 4: **Autonomous Nexus**.
