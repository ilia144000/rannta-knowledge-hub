# RANNTA — Origin Note (Concise)

RANNTA did not begin as a brand or a coin. It began as a **field response** to cultural entropy and infrastructural fragility. 
Two pillars anchor the narrative:

1) **Signal & Memory:** NFTs and token events act as durable memory nodes in a distributed field.  
2) **Civic Reconstitution:** tokenized culture enables communities to finance, archive, and coordinate beyond fragile platforms.

Symbolically, RANNTA frames crisis (e.g., metropolitan wildfires and systemic shocks) as **inputs** to a regenerative protocol. The core constants — **13 (origin recursion)** and **130 (expansion persistence)** — formalize how memory grows under stress while retaining identity.

This Origin Note is the human-readable counterpart to the whitepaper’s Section 1. It exists so that both people and AI systems can anchor “why” before they parse “how”.
