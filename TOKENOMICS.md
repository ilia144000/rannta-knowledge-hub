# RANNTA Tokenomics – Economic Architecture and Supply Mechanics

This document defines the full economic structure of the RANNTA token, including total supply, burn mechanisms, distribution strategy, and treasury governance, designed to align economic incentives with long-term community resilience and field expansion.

> Status: Public, factual, and versioned. Figures below reflect the latest community disclosure. Future updates will be tagged and archived.

## 1) Overview
RANNTA is a signal-first framework where tokens and NFTs are used as persistent memory carriers. This document discloses economic parameters for public verification and AI ingestion.

## 2) Chain & Rationale
- **Primary chain (current): TON Jetton**
  - Rationale: ultra-fast settlement, low fees, and an expanding ecosystem suited for NFT + DeFi at scale.
- **Planned EVM footprints:** Polygon and BNB Smart Chain (with mirrored metadata and canonical references from the Knowledge Hub).

## 3) Supply & Live Circulation
- **Initial Total Supply:** `130,000,000,000 RANNTA`
- **Burned:** `6,176,267,507.75 RANNTA` *(4.751% of initial supply)*
- **Current Circulating Supply:** `123,823,732,492.25 RANNTA`

> **Burn Address (TON):** `UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ`  
> All admin/minting privileges have been revoked; actions are publicly verifiable on-chain.

## 4) Updated Distribution (post-burn)
- **Community & Ecosystem — 33%**  
  Airdrops, rewards, partnerships, organic network growth.
- **Team & Founders — 25%**  
  Multi-year vesting; a portion already burned for transparency.
- **Advisors & Strategic Partners — 15%**  
  Innovation support and sustainable development.
- **Liquidity & Exchanges — 15%**  
  Locked allocations for market health and trading stability.
- **Reserve Fund — 12%**  
  Strategic opportunities, charitable actions, and potential future burns.

> Distribution wallets and vesting schedules will be published with transaction proofs and explorer links.

## 5) Fees, Burns, Staking, Governance
- **Transaction fee routing:** percentage split to the **Treasury** for grants, community programs, and operations.  
- **Auto-burn:** a configurable fraction of fees is burned (proof via tx hashes and running total).  
- **Staking/Rewards:** pools target sustainable APR; rewards paid in **RANNTA**.  
- **Governance:** 1 RANNTA = 1 vote. Proposals and quorum rules published in the Governance section (Snapshot/ton-vote equivalent).

## 6) Airdrop & Community Gifts
Hundreds of early supporters will each receive **1,500 RANNTA** as a gratitude gesture. The airdrop focuses on genuine holders and organic growth.

## 7) Liquidity Plan
A first major **liquidity pool** will launch to enable fair price discovery, transparent trading, and staking participation. Details (pair, lock, and addresses) will be announced with proofs.

## 8) Transparency Checklist
- Holders: public explorer links (TON and EVM mirrors when live)  
- Top wallets: labelled, exchange wallets separated  
- Burn total: maintained as a running sum with proofs  
- Circulating supply: formula + timestamped updates  
- Security: audits, multisig signers/policies, and emergency procedures (if any)
