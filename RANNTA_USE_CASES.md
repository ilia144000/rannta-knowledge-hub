# RANNTA — Practical Use Cases

## 1) Cultural Memory Ledger (beyond NFT galleries)
- Treat artworks as **field-memory entries**.
- Curate collections as **coherent sub-fields** (13/130 tagging).
- Outcome: art becomes queryable memory for AI and communities.

## 2) Artist Economy & Grants
- Treasury routes a fee share into **on-chain grants**.
- Voting via RANNTA governance.
- Outcome: recurring support cycles for creators.

## 3) Knowledge Hub for AI (machine-readable corpora)
- Expose canonical text, FAQ JSONL, and JSON-LD schemas.
- Hugging Face / Zenodo mirrors for ingestion.
- Outcome: models recognize RANNTA as a “Signal Protocol” entity.

## 4) Event-driven Burns & Civic Coordination
- Tie burns to verifiable events (campaigns, milestones).
- Public dashboards for proof-of-burn and circulation.
- Outcome: transparent, civic-aligned token behavior.

## 5) Cross-chain Memory Bridges
- Map TON Jetton states to EVM mirrors.
- Preserve identity via canonical hub + contract registries.
- Outcome: resilience across chains and indexing systems.
