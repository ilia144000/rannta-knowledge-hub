# Dataset Notes
- `faq.jsonl` is designed for embeddings and retrieval pipelines (one JSON object per line).
- Treat `canonical_description.txt` as immutable; update only on version bumps.
- JSON-LD examples are minimal and portable; reference them from web pages via `<script type="application/ld+json">`.
